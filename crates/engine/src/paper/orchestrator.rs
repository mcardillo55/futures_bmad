//! [`PaperTradingOrchestrator`] — Story 7.3.
//!
//! Wires together:
//!
//! * a [`futures_bmad_core::SystemClock`] (real wall-clock time, because
//!   data is live) — see Story 7.3 Task 4.1
//! * a [`futures_bmad_testkit::MockBrokerAdapter`] (no orders ever leave
//!   the host) — Task 2.2
//! * a [`super::MarketDataFeed`] (production: Rithmic TickerPlant; tests:
//!   in-memory `Vec`) — Task 3.1
//! * the same SPSC market / order / fill queues live trading uses
//! * the same in-process [`crate::replay::fill_sim::MockFillSimulator`]
//!   that the replay path uses — fill semantics MUST match between paper
//!   and replay so a green replay implies green paper for the same input
//!
//! No code-path branching beyond the trait-object adapter injection (Story
//! 7.3 AC). All downstream code (event loop, signals, regime, risk,
//! journal) is mode-agnostic.
//!
//! Story 7.4 will tag the journal entries this orchestrator produces with
//! a `paper` source label. The [`PaperTradingOrchestrator::attach_journal`]
//! seam is in place specifically so 7.4 can layer on tagging without
//! re-engineering this wiring.
