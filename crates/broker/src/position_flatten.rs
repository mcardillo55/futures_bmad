//! Position flatten retry — the broker-side mechanism that drives a market
//! flatten order through the [`OrderSubmitter`] trait, retrying up to
//! `FLATTEN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` times with a `FLATTEN_RETRY_INTERVAL` delay between
//! attempts (per architecture spec).
//!
//! ```text
//!   submit market flatten ─► success ─► FlattenOutcome::Success
//!         │
//!         ▼
//!     submission error
//!         │
//!         ▼
//!     wait FLATTEN_RETRY_INTERVAL (1s)
//!         │
//!         ▼
//!     retry, up to FLATTEN_MAX_ATTEMPTS (3) total
//!         │
//!         ▼
//!     all attempts failed ─► FlattenOutcome::Failed { attempts }
//!                            (caller engages PanicMode)
//! ```
//!
//! Critical invariants:
//! - The flatten order is always a Market order — a stop or limit could fail to
//!   fill at all. Speed beats slippage when the position is unprotected.
//! - The retry sleep runs on the Tokio runtime; the engine hot path is notified
//!   of the outcome via the FillQueue (the engine never blocks on this).
//! - This module does NOT activate panic mode itself. It only reports
//!   `FlattenOutcome::Failed { attempts }` after exhausting retries. The
//!   engine-side risk module (`engine::risk::panic_mode`) decides what to do.
